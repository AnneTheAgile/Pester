This branch contains non-production unsupported code.

The ISESteroids does not automatically update the snippets after load, (or I am doing it wrong). So in order to use the snippets you should either load Pester before ISESteroids (not recommended) or place the ```Snippets``` folder in your ```Split-Path -Path $profile -Parent``` folder. 

In my case: C:\Users\nohwnd\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Snippets
